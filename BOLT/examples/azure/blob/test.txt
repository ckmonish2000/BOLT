Built on Azure Blob Storage
The data that you ingest persist as blobs in the storage account. The service that manages blobs is the Azure Blob Storage service. Data Lake Storage Gen2 describes the capabilities or "enhancements" to this service that caters to the demands of big data analytic workloads.

Because these capabilities are built on Blob Storage, features such as diagnostic logging, access tiers, and lifecycle management policies are available to your account. Most Blob Storage features are fully supported, but some features might be supported only at the preview level and there are a handful of them that aren't yet supported. For a complete list of support statements, see Blob Storage feature support in Azure Storage accounts. The status of each listed feature will change over time as support continues to expand.
